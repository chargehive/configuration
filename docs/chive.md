# ChargeHive Tool - `chive`
All the json configuration files for ChargeHive are applied using the `chive` command line tool. 
With this tool you can create, remove, update and delete policies and configurations. 

## Installation

You will need a `project-id` and an `access-token` from ChargeHive. If you do not have these, get in touch with support.

Download `chive` for your system:
+ [Windows](https://cdn.chargehive.com/tools/chive/dist/windows/chive.exe)
+ [Mac](https://cdn.chargehive.com/tools/chive/dist/mac/chive)

To use the `chive` tool, you can either call it directly with your credentials:
```
chive --project-id="your-project-id" --access-token="your-access-token"
```

Or you can create a credentials file `.chive.yaml` with the following structure:
```yaml
projectID: your-project-id
accessToken: your-access-token
```

You can use the `.chive.yaml` config by any of these methods:
- storing it in the same directory as the `chive` executable
- storing it in the `$HOME` directory
- set where `chive` looks for the file: `chive --config-file="/path/to/your/config/.chive.yaml` and put it there

Once this is done, you should run `chive health` to check that your credentials are correct.
If you receive an error, please get in contact for support.
